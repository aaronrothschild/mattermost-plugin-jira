# Manual Jira Webhooks

## Manual Webhooks

An IT Administrator can setup a JQL query in Jira and point the resulting events at a Mattermost webhook for a specific channel. However, this will require an IT admin who has permission to setup such a webhook to do this for each channel in Mattermost which can become an administrative burden.  The alternative, is using the new "Notification Subscriptions" feature from within Mattermost.
